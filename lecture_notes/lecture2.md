# Ideation

Ideation can come in many forms. Ideation can happen anywhere (even remotely) at any time. It can happen in 15 minutes, or throughout several months. Ideation can tackle small design challenges and brand new products.

At the end of this module, you should be able to:
- articulate why lo-fi ideation is a key component of the UX design process.
- to sketch ideas digitally.
- execute a 'Crazy 8s' ideation exercise.

## Ideation Sessions

All ideation sessions have three main characteristics.

### Ideas are not evaluated. 

We want to make sure that ideation sessions are void of critiques. It is essential that everyone feels comfortable ideating without being evaluated. Fostering the proper environment is of the utmost importance when conducting ideation sessions. Even potentially bad options can lay the groundwork for fantastic solutions.

### Ideas are recorded, and the session is documented. 

We can record ideas in many ways. Paper, pencil, voice recorder, video recorder, camera, and markers are just a few of the many ways that we can document ideas. It is essential that ideas are documented to ensure the participants/stakeholders can evaluate the ideas at a later date. It is essential to avoid deleting artifacts, as they all hold valuable information that can be used and built upon later.

### Collaboration spurs diverse ideas. 

Ideation can happen both alone and in a group. However, ideating with another individual, or a group can help spur creativity. Ideating with a group of diverse individuals helps to bring a diverse set of backgrounds, and therefore viewpoints, to the table. Ideating in this manner will likely save time and frustration in the long-run.

## Ideation Challenges

The most common complaint against conducting ideation sessions is a lack of time during an already constrained product design cycle (NNGroup). Although ideation does take time, it is important to remember that even a single session of 3 hours or less can uncover valuable information that can significantly impact the success of a product. Frequently, how participants spend their time during an ideation session is the most significant indicator of how successful the session will be. Remaining focused on the task at hand and properly documenting the ideation session helps to get the most value out of the session.

A lack of upper managerial support can also have a significant impact on the ability to conduct ideation sessions. If upper management does not support taking time to conduct this type of work, it can be challenging to get others to participate. Showing value early in the process and explaining how group ideation could have solved issues in the past are a couples way of potentially dealing with a lack of managerial support.

Ideation at any point in the product design process is beneficial. However, there are times when ideation is more beneficial than others. Ideation tends to be most effective directly after user research. Ideating after user research helps to keep the team focused on the outcomes of the research, and build toward a practical prototype.
