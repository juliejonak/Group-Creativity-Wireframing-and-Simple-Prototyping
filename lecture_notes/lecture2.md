# Ideation

Ideation can come in many forms. Ideation can happen anywhere (even remotely) at any time. It can happen in 15 minutes, or throughout several months. Ideation can tackle small design challenges and brand new products.

At the end of this module, you should be able to:
- articulate why lo-fi ideation is a key component of the UX design process.
- to sketch ideas digitally.
- execute a 'Crazy 8s' ideation exercise.
