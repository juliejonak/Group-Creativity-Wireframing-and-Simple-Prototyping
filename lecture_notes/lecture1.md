# Group Creativity and Leading UX Workshops

Digital design work is almost always done in collaboration with at least one other person and generally requires the ability to work closely and effectively with others to create a great product. Product design work is also one of the primary places companies can create a culture of innovation. Most companies are beginning to recognize that innovation is a key to growth in the modern economy. 

> “Win through innovation or lose the game.”

 - explain key fundamental considerations of group creativity.
 - explain the model for facilitating UX workshops.

## Assignment

The Assignment can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xlo97NXJ9wKwhRgpOrgJSJmeelGFXFgbM-bxdMcmbWc/edit).

#### Instructions

Divide into groups of three. Each person will lead a UX workshop for 40 minutes. 

Each workshop will consist of: 
Brainstorm or mash-up for 20 minutes
Affinity mapping for 20 minutes
Dot voting for best ideas for 10 minutes

One student will act as facilitator for the full 40 minute workshop. The group will take a ~10 minute break, then a new student will lead a workshop for 40 minutes.

The workshops will cover your selected project.

When you are finished with your workshop, connect with your PMs and show screenshots of the work that you completed.

<br>

#### Submission

Student leads a 40 minute (for PT) or 60 minute (for FT) workshop that included brainstorming, affinity mapping, and dot voting exercises. Student submits documents showing evidence of his/her work.

Creativity is an open book. It is idea generation. Creating something from nothing or assembling new things from old things. Absurd ideas are put on the table—welcomed at the table. Creativity is often a solo act. You reach deep inside to crack open whatever is lurking in your subconscious and let it out. The research has shown that individuals can often generate more ideas and more creative ideas than a group can in the same time constraints.

However, it is becoming increasingly difficult in the modern world to move from creative idea to product independently. You need a team.

When you add human interaction, creativity suddenly has another dimension of complexity to deal with. Social cues and perceived social hierarchy can affect the flow of creativity.

One impact of this is that people can begin to bandwagon around a specific idea, fixating on the ideas from the loudest voice or the ideas of the highest authority figure.

Another impact is that, as ideas get floated, people can begin to defend their territory so to speak as well, conflating their own self worth with the perceived reception of their ideas.

Others in a group hold back their ideas because they’re not the fastest talker or the loudest. They’ll hold back their ideas because others are taking the stage more readily.

Digital design work is almost always done in collaboration with at least one other person and generally requires the ability to work closely and effectively with others to create a great product. Thus it can suffer from the complexities inherent in group creativity.

Because of the complexity of software and business solutions, it’s not really possible for one person to be the source of creative vision. Sure, one person will need to act as the deciding power on what path to take, but collaborative creativity will be required along the way by all members of the team. The work of the group will be required to refine the creative ideas into workable business solutions. That is, the innovation that moves a business forward.

Most companies are beginning to recognize that innovation is a key to growth in the modern economy. “Win through innovation or lose the game.” Without innovation, products become commoditized. Businesses that don’t innovate tend to fizzle, because the only thing they can compete on is price. Eventually, someone else comes up with a novel way of doing things or adds some other level of quality. Innovation trumps the commodity.

UX design work is one of the primary places companies can create a culture of innovation. UX design as a field has built tools and processes and systems that can help make the messy process of creative collaboration go more smoothly. By involving the full product team in the creative process, UX designers can help increase buy-in from team members for the direction of the project. Workshops and activities can help teams shave off the rough edges of their creative efforts to move forward their product design more efficiently.

A UX designer takes a leading role in their organization to advocate for collaborative creativity and practices deliberate and systematic exercises that have shown to help improve collaboration and innovation in organizations.

He or she often facilitates workshops that help promote ideation and help prioritize or clarify direction for a product. This position allows UX designers to build the team’s ability to function together effectively to get the best results for their product.

Facilitating workshops can be part of the creative process to bring all the complexities of group work into harmony leading to quicker solutions to problems, more shared understanding within the group, and overall better designs in the end.

UX design processes and workshops help corral the messy creative process to promote innovation, which is a key to business success.

A UX workshop is really any group activity that is aimed at moving the product design cycle forward, especially as those activities help center the group on user needs and objectives. Examples of UX workshops include brainstorming sessions, affinity diagramming, assumption analysis and prioritization, and design sprints.

A UX designer usually facilitates UX workshops during the ideation phase, but there are workshops UX designers can conduct during discovery and definition phases to help guide those efforts as well. There are also workshops that can last days and that span all phases of the product design cycle. These workshops are often called sprints and are usually facilitated by UX designers. We’ll cover design sprints later in the program.

The UX designer’s role rests at the nexus of business concerns, user interaction, and the technical development. That position offers a convenient rallying point for gathering the disparate parts of an organization together. It becomes an opportunity to help the whole team understand the user who is the beneficiary of the product and help unify the vision of what the team is creating and why it matters.

Each project and organization is different. It’s good to develop a belt of tools you can use. As you move through the product design cycle, it may be beneficial at almost any point along the process to perform a UX workshop to get the team past a stumbling block that is halting progress.

Who you invite to the group depends on the workshop. You should almost always keep the group at less than 10 people, including facilitator. The team working on the product feature that is being considered in the workshop is always the right group. If you are in ideation mode, bringing in a more diverse group is helpful to get a broader perspective.

Also, for ideation workshops, avoid bringing in folks too high up in the company hierarchy as that can disrupt creative output. Those folks will be needed to make decisions on proposed ideas eventually, but for the purposes of creativity, keep them out of the room.

The model that follows can be used to facilitate a brief workshop of only 30 minutes or a full-day workshop.

Note: When facilitating a workshop, you should avoid acting as a contributor or participant of the workshop. As the authority figure of the workshop, your contributions would be given undue weight. Sometimes the size of the group means you would likely need to participate. In that case you can also take turns with others in the group acting as facilitators for individual exercises.
